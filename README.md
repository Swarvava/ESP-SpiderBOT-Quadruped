# 🕷️ ESP-SpiderBOT-Quadruped

The SpiderBOT is a **Bluetooth-controlled quadruped walking robot** built using **ESP32** and **PCA9685 servo driver**.  
It mimics insect-like movement using a biologically inspired **creep gait algorithm**.

---

## 📖 Description

ESP SpiderBOT is a four-legged robotic platform developed using MicroPython on ESP32.
Each leg contains two servo motors (hip + knee joint), enabling lifting, stepping, and propulsion.

The robot is controlled wirelessly using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE UART Service) from a smartphone.

A biologically inspired creep gait pattern is implemented to maintain stability by moving one leg at a time while the other three support the body.

# ESP SpiderBOT demonstrates:
- Real-time servo coordination  
- Wireless Bluetooth control  
- Stable gait-based locomotion  

### Core Hardware:
- **ESP32** – main controller (MCU)  
- **PCA9685** – multi-servo PWM driver  
- **BLE UART** – wireless commands  

Each leg has **2 DOF (hip + knee)** enabling realistic motion.
